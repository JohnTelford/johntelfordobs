## Website Components

This site is built using website components :

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator. It is an open-source website framework created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/). It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive.

- Features I like about Docusaurus are:
	- Powered by React,JSX and MDX
	- Extend and customize with React
	- Hot web browser reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
	- Route-based code and data splitting
	- Heading anchor links
	- Check all links during build process
	- Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
	- Search
		- [Algolia DocSearch](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#using-algolia-docsearch)
		- Local Search - Small and is downloaded to browsers 
	- Menus
		- Leftside - menu bar
		- Blog left side - posts
		- Rightside - page / post table of contents
	- Learn more

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/) . 


- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) components in MDX documents. One can import React components such as user interfaces, interactive charts, alerts or other components.

## Development Tools

### Editor

I rank editors as the top of the development tools stack, as shown in the [Development Stack](developmentstack). My choice is [VScode](developmenttools#vscode) (Visual Studio Code). Some useful extensions are:

- Dark+ Material.  
The default Dark+ theme, using Material's color palette

- ESlint.  
Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code

- GitHub Repositories.  
Remotely browse and edit any GitHub repository

- Lorem Text Generator  
Lorem text generator extension for vscode

-  Markdown All in One  
All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more)

- MDX  
MDX for Visual Studio Code

- Rainbow Brackets  
Provide rainbow colors for the round brackets, the square brackets and the squiggly brackets

- Todo Tree  
This extension quickly searches (using ripgrep) your workspace for comment tags like TODO and FIXME, and displays them in a tree view in the activity bar

- vscode-icons  
Icons for Visual Studio Code

### iA Writer

I prefer [iA Writer](material#iawriter) for editing website material and blog posts. Using iA Writerl is faster: 
- Focus without editor distractions
- Grammar and spelling checking
- Live Preview
- Sort file
	- Name
	- Modification time 
- Text 
	- Lookup
	- Transformation
- [ChronoSync](material#chronosync) is used to keep iA Write and local repository files in sync

### Git Client

VScode built-in git commands :

 - Review diffs, 
 - Stage files
 - Make commits
 - Push 
 - pull 

---

### Fork
Git repositories are fundamental to a project, I use [Fork](https://git-fork.com) to augment VScode git commands:

- Repository Manager Summary and Statistics
- Fetch, pull, push
- Commit, amend
- Create and delete branches and tags
- Create and delete remote repos
- Checkout branch or revision
- Cherry-pick, revert
- Merge
- Rebase
- Stashes
- Submodules
- Interactive rebase
- Blame
- Browse the repository file tree at any commit
- Intuitive merge conflict resolving
- Restore lost commits with Reflog
- See stashes right in the commit list
- Git-flow
- Git LFS
- GPG
