### Docusaurus

I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools) and other static site generators. This latest reincarnations was built using Docusaurus development framework.

The website design prerequisites can be realized using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework. Docusaurus attributes may be edited. `Docusaurus` abstracts `react` which uses `mdx` and `jsx` for creating user interfaces.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator. It is created and open-sourced by [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/)
