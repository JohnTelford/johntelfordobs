Web browser interprets the standard [Troika](programming#troika) languages and renders the website.

The job of a static site generators is compile the website pages written in troika and non [Troika](programming#troika) programming languages such as Markdown, into a single file containing a combination of standard [Troika](programming#troika) languages web for browsers to interpret.

A web browser loads the website single file from the website server and interprets and renders the website.
