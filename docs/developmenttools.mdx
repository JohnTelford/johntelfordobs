    - Faster way to write MDX website material 
    - Extensive Style Check
    - Focus

        - Paragraph
    - Available for Mac, iOS, Windows, and Android

When my iMac isnâ€™t handy, I use my iPad or iPhone to edit files. iA Writer stores files in iCloud. They are available when I have an internet connection.

When one or more pages have been edited using iA Writer, the  [ChronoSync](https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html) app is used to synchronize files from iA Writer to local repository or visa versa. Since the  iA Writer files are store in iCloud, they can be edited remotely using  laptops, smart phones, or pads.
