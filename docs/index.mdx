# Introduction

Creating and maintaining websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, and time consuming.

---

This website was created by [johntelford.com LLC](company). It is about optimizing website project life time costs using a static site generator for developing and deploying websites. It is based on *Iterative Development* and *Web Component Technologies*.

---

The slightest errors or security issues during development will require remediation sometime during the life time of the website. The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

Content and software defects cost less when found early during development
