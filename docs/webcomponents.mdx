# Website Components
 
This site is built using website components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator. It is an open-source website framework created by Facebook. It builds a single-page application with a fast client-side navigation, leveraging React to make websites interactive. [Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs#features)

    - Some features I like about Docusaurus are:
        - Powered by JSX and MDX
        - Extend and customize with React
        - Hot web browser reloading with fast incremental build on edit changes
        - Route-based code and data splitting
        - Check for errors by building deployment website on local server, using the same process as the deployment server
        - Blog MDX files
        - Blog and file:
            - Side Menu
                - Website project
                - Blog posts
            - MDX files Table of Contents

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing [JSX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/#jsx) components in MDX documents. One can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components.
